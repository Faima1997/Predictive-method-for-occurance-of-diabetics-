# Predictive-method-for-occurance-of-diabetics-
Creating a Predictive Model for the Occurrence of Diabetes

The dataset used was taken from the UCI Machine Learning repository and can also be found on Kaggle. The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of this short project is, using the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases dataset, to predict whether or not a pregnant patient has diabetes, based on some diagnostic measurements.

The dataset formed especially by women at least 21 years of age, contains several medical predictor variables and a target variable, the outcome. Predictive medical variables, or input data, include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, her BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
